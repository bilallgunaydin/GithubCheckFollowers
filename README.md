I made a project using Rest Assured and Selenium, which detects those who do not follow you on Github and removes them from the ones you follow.

**Selenium**: Test Automation Tool used to test Website 

**WebDriverManager**: WebDriverManager is an open-source Java library that carries out the management (i.e., download, setup, and maintenance) of the drivers required by Selenium WebDriver (e.g., chromedriver, geckodriver, msedgedriver, etc.) in a fully automated manner. In addition, as of version 5, WebDriverManager provides other relevant features, such as the capability to discover browsers installed in the local system, building WebDriver objects (such as ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, EdgeDriver, etc.), running browsers in Docker containers seamlessly, and monitoring capabilities.

![Page-Object-Model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21973124/198896027-6ad45ea7-7ac5-4a5d-ae30-34a7ae5efcda.png) **Page Obj ect Model**: It is the architectural structure used in the project.

![Rest-Assured](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21973124/221045722-f0acbfab-8c02-43f1-83ce-58b218882dee.png) **Rest-Assured**: Rest Assured is an open source library in Java and is used for testing HTTP Web services. This library makes it easy to create HTTP requests and process HTTP responses. Rest Assured is designed to test web services based on REST (Real Time Collaboration) architecture, but can also be applied to other types of web services.

![Junit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21973124/221034802-128fa8ba-16e5-43be-8012-e95a0d808eb3.png) **Junit**: JUnit is an open source test automation tool in Java language. The purpose of this tool is to provide a simple, repeatable and readable testing framework that is used to test the accuracy of your code. JUnit is very widely used in the Java world, as well as the existence of similar tools for many other languages.

In this format, data is displayed in a structured way and is usually used for the storage or transmission of data returned by a web service or requested by a web.

This library automatically converts JSON data to Java objects (deserialize) and converts Java objects to JSON data (serialize).

![log4j](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21973124/221046060-6dee577f-68d4-4075-ac1e-fd86107f8e05.png) **LOG4J**: log4j is a reliable, fast and flexible logging framework (APIs) written in Java, which is distributed under the Apache Software License.
